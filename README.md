# Healthcare Predictive Modeling System

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based healthcare prediction system that helps diagnose various conditions based on patient symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory results. The system uses advanced AI algorithms to provide accurate disease predictions and risk assessments.

## Features
- Real-time disease prediction
- Interactive web interface
- Patient history tracking
- Analytics dashboard
- Automated reporting
- Multi-disease classification
- Confidence score for predictions

## Diseases Covered
- COVID-19
- Heart Disease
- Influenza
- Pneumonia

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+
- **ML Framework**: scikit-learn
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier with SMOTE balancing
